# Astro Pi 2022/23

This repository contains the study and report of experiments with the [Astro Pi](https://github.com/raspberrypilearning/astro-pi-guide)
for the [European Astro Pi Challenge 2022/23](https://astro-pi.org/), [Mission Space Lab](https://astro-pi.org/mission-space-lab/) (see [details](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/768-teams-entered-astro-pi-mission-space-lab-2022-23/) to know some numbers).
It is part of the [educational repositories](https://github.com/pandle/materials) to learn how to manage a project.

## Study

Before to subcribe the team, we have evaluated some experiments and the public data [described here](study/README.md).

What we have learned:

* [how to](TOOLS.md) use the tools for this project
* [how to](study/README.md) read the graphics of the Astro PI metrics
* what the machine learning [steps](https://github.com/mrdbourke/zero-to-mastery-ml/blob/master/section-1-getting-ready-for-machine-learning/a-6-step-framework-for-approaching-machine-learning-projects.md) are
